# Activity Log - 2026-01-20

## Summary
Fixed critical plugin issues preventing syntax highlighting from working. Added custom SyntaxHighlighter and simplified the parser to stop generating false errors.

## Changes Made
- [x] Created `ElvishSyntaxHighlighter` - maps lexer tokens to IDE text attributes
- [x] Created `ElvishSyntaxHighlighterFactory` - factory for highlighter registration
- [x] Registered syntax highlighter in plugin.xml
- [x] Simplified `ElvishParser` to minimal token-grouping without validation
- [x] Simplified `ElvishElementTypes` to only FILE and STATEMENT
- [x] Updated parser tests to match new minimal parser behavior
- [x] Set up activity logging system

## Files Modified
- `src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/highlighting/ElvishSyntaxHighlighter.kt` - NEW: Token-to-color mapping
- `src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/highlighting/ElvishSyntaxHighlighterFactory.kt` - NEW: Factory class
- `src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishParser.kt` - Simplified to accept all syntax
- `src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishElementTypes.kt` - Reduced to minimal types
- `src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml` - Added syntaxHighlighterFactory extension
- `src/main/resources/textmate/package.json` - Fixed language ID to match "Elvish"
- `src/test/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishParserTest.kt` - Updated for new parser
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - NEW: Project changelog
- `docs/activity/README.md` - NEW: Activity log documentation
- `docs/activity/2026-01-20.md` - NEW: Today's activity log

## Decisions Made
- **Minimal parser approach**: Parser now just groups tokens into statements without syntax validation. LSP provides real language intelligence. This prevents false errors for valid Elvish syntax the parser doesn't understand (like `path:dir`).
- **Custom lexer over TextMate**: Using custom lexer for highlighting provides better control and consistent behavior across IDE editions.

## Issues Encountered
- **No syntax highlighting**: Lexer was producing tokens but no SyntaxHighlighter was registered to map them to colors. Fixed by creating ElvishSyntaxHighlighter.
- **222 parser errors**: Complex parser tried to validate syntax but didn't understand Elvish constructs like namespaced commands (`path:dir`). Fixed by simplifying parser to accept everything.
- **TextMate language ID mismatch**: package.json used "elvish" but Language class used "Elvish". Fixed by aligning to "Elvish".

## Additional Changes
- [x] Added activity logging requirement to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Integrated activity logging into Ralph's prompt (start, success, blocked)
- [x] Set up docs/CHANGELOG.md and docs/activity/ logging system

## Research: Cross-IDE LSP Support

Discovered critical issue: Plugin uses `com.intellij.modules.ultimate` which only works in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, not other JetBrains IDEs.

**Key findings:**
- Should use `com.intellij.modules.lsp` instead (available in all paid JetBrains IDEs since 2024.2)
- As of 2025.3, JetBrains has unified distribution - LSP is free for ALL users
- No more Community vs Ultimate distinction

**Plan created:** `docs/plans/cross-ide-lsp-fix.md`

## PRD Update
- Archived old prd.json to `scripts/ralph/archive/initial-plan-prd.json`
- Created new prd.json with 10 stories for cross-IDE LSP fix (STORY-101 to STORY-110)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run Ralph to implement cross-IDE LSP fix stories
- [ ] Test LSP features in sandbox IDE
- [ ] Test in multiple JetBrains IDEs
- [ ] Prepare for marketplace submission
