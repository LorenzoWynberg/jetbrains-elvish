## Summary
Completed STORY-105: Test LSP code completion. Created integration tests that verify Elvish LSP provides code completion for variables, commands, and module functions.

## Changes Made
- [x] Created ElvishLspCompletionTest.kt with 5 tests for completion functionality
- [x] Created LspTestUtils.kt with shared utilities for LSP testing
- [x] Refactored ElvishLspIntegrationTest.kt to use shared utilities

## Files Modified
- `src/test/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/lsp/ElvishLspCompletionTest.kt` - New file with 5 completion tests
- `src/test/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/lsp/LspTestUtils.kt` - New file with shared LSP test utilities
- `src/test/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/lsp/ElvishLspIntegrationTest.kt` - Refactored to use LspTestUtils

## Decisions Made
- Following same approach as STORY-104: writing automated integration tests rather than requiring manual GUI testing
- Tests communicate directly with `elvish -lsp` process using JSON-RPC protocol
- Extracted shared LSP test utilities to reduce duplication and keep file sizes under 300 lines

## Tests Added
1. `testVariableCompletion` - Verifies completion works when typing $
2. `testCommandCompletion` - Verifies completion for partial command names
3. `testModuleCompletion` - Verifies completion for module functions (e.g., str:)
4. `testCompletionHasDocumentation` - Verifies completion responses include signatures
5. `testSpecialVariableCompletion` - Verifies completion for special variables

## Refactoring Done
- Round 1: Extracted LspTestUtils.kt to share code between test files
- Round 2: Verified all files under 300 lines, no further changes needed

## Next Steps
- STORY-106: Test LSP hover documentation
- STORY-107: Test LSP diagnostics
