# JetBrains Elvish Plugin - Development Progress

## Codebase Patterns

- **Build System**: Gradle with IntelliJ Platform Plugin 2.10.5
- **Language**: Kotlin 1.9.25 with Java 21 toolchain
- **Target IDE**: IntelliJ Ultimate 2024.3 (build range 243-251.*)
- **LSP**: Uses JetBrains official LSP API (not LSP4IJ)
- **Commits**: No Co-Authored-By lines, concise commit messages
- **Branches**: Feature branches from main, PRs merged back

## Architecture Decisions

- **Minimal parser**: LSP handles all language intelligence
- **Project-wide LSP**: Single server instance per project
- **TextMate for highlighting**: Phase 4 will add grammar-based syntax highlighting
- **Settings optional**: Default to 'elvish' in PATH

- Plugin runs in sandbox IDE with ./gradlew runIde
- .elv files recognized with custom icon
- LSP server starts when opening .elv files (requires elvish in PATH)
- TextMate grammar created (awaiting bundle provider registration for highlighting)

---

## 2026-01-20 - STORY-011: Create ElvishTextMateBundleProvider

**What was done:**
- Created ElvishTextMateBundleProvider implementing TextMateBundleProvider interface
- getBundles() returns list with PluginBundle("Elvish", path) pointing to /textmate resource directory
- Added bundledPlugin("org.jetbrains.plugins.textmate") dependency to build.gradle.kts
- Used java.nio.file.Path and javaClass.getResource to locate bundle at runtime

**Files created:**
- src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/textmate/ElvishTextMateBundleProvider.kt

**Files changed:**
- build.gradle.kts (added textmate bundled plugin dependency)

**Learnings:**
- TextMateBundleProvider interface is in org.jetbrains.plugins.textmate.api package
- PluginBundle is a data class taking name (String) and path (Path)
- The path points to the directory containing the grammar file, not the file itself
- Bundled plugins added via bundledPlugin() in intellijPlatform dependencies block

---

## 2026-01-20 - STORY-012: Register TextMate bundle in plugin.xml

**What was done:**
- Added dependency on org.jetbrains.plugins.textmate in plugin.xml
- Registered ElvishTextMateBundleProvider as bundleProvider extension
- Extension uses org.jetbrains.plugins.textmate namespace (not com.intellij)

**Files changed:**
- src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml (added depends and bundleProvider extension)

**Learnings:**
- TextMate extensions use a separate namespace: org.jetbrains.plugins.textmate
- The extension point is "bundleProvider" (not "textmate.bundleProvider")
- Plugin must declare dependency on textmate plugin for the extension to work

---

## 2026-01-20 - STORY-013: Test and verify syntax highlighting

**What was done:**
- Verified ./gradlew build passes successfully
- Reviewed TextMate grammar (elvish.tmLanguage.json) - all scopes correctly defined
- Reviewed bundle provider (ElvishTextMateBundleProvider.kt) - correctly returns bundle path
- Verified plugin.xml registration - bundleProvider extension correctly registered
- Created comprehensive test .elv file (src/test/resources/test-syntax.elv) with all syntax elements
- Verified plugin ZIP contains all TextMate resources
- Performed 2 rounds of refactor checking - no changes needed (code well-organized)

**Test file coverage:**
- Comments (# style)
- Control keywords (if, elif, else, while, for, try, catch, finally, break, continue, return)
- Other keywords (fn, var, set, tmp, del, use, pragma, and, or, coalesce)
- Constants ($true, $false, $nil, $ok, nop)
- Numbers (integer, float, hex, octal, binary, rational, Inf, NaN)
- Strings (single-quoted, double-quoted with escapes and interpolation)
- Variables ($var, $@explode, $namespace:var)
- Built-in functions (60+ functions tested)
- Operators (comparison, arithmetic, pipe, range, redirection)
- Punctuation (brackets, braces, parens, semicolons, ampersands)

**Scope to color mapping (Material Palenight theme):**
- comment.line -> gray (#676E95)
- keyword.control, keyword.other -> purple (#C792EA)
- string.quoted -> green (#C3E88D)
- constant.numeric -> orange (#F78C6C)
- support.function.builtin -> blue (#82AAFF)
- variable.other -> yellow (#FFCB6B)

**Files created:**
- src/test/resources/test-syntax.elv

**Learnings:**
- TextMate grammar colors depend on the IDE theme, not the grammar itself
- Grammar assigns semantic scopes; themes map scopes to colors
- The plugin ZIP correctly packages textmate/ directory inside the JAR
- Build requires Java 21 (JAVA_HOME must be set if default is lower)

- Created ElvishTokenType class extending IElementType with ElvishLanguage.INSTANCE
- All types use @JvmField for Java interoperability

**Files created:**
- src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishTokenTypes.kt

**Learnings:**
- IElementType requires a Language instance to associate tokens with the language
- TokenSet.create() is used to group related token types for parser use
- @JvmField annotation exposes Kotlin vals as Java fields
- Parser-related code belongs in a dedicated `parser` package

---

## 2026-01-20 - STORY-015: Create ElvishLexer

**What was done:**
- Created ElvishLexer.kt extending LexerBase in the `parser` package
- Implemented comprehensive tokenization for all Elvish syntax elements:
  - Comments: Recognizes # comments to end of line
  - Strings: Single-quoted (with '' escape) and double-quoted (with \ escapes)
  - Keywords: All 21 keywords mapped to specific token types
  - Identifiers: Supports hyphens in names (e.g., my-function)
  - Variables: $var, $@explode, $namespace:var formats
  - Constants: $true, $false, $nil recognized as specific token types
  - Numbers: Integer, float, hex (0x), octal (0o), binary (0b), rationals (22/7), scientific notation

**Learnings:**
- LexerBase provides a clean interface for implementing custom lexers
- IntelliJ lexers return IElementType tokens and manage buffer positions manually
- Elvish allows hyphens in identifiers, which is unusual compared to most languages
- Rational numbers (e.g., 22/7) are represented as FLOAT tokens
- The `>>` redirect operator is context-dependent in Elvish

  - Other: BLOCK, PARAMETER_LIST, ARGUMENT_LIST, VARIABLE_REFERENCE, USE_DIRECTIVE, PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE
- Created ElvishParser.kt implementing PsiParser with comprehensive parsing:
  - parseFile: Main loop consuming statements until EOF
  - parseStatement: Dispatches to specific parsers based on token type
  - parseFunctionDefinition: Handles `fn` keyword with optional name and block body
  - parseVariableStatement: Handles var/set/tmp/del with optional assignment
  - parseIfStatement: Handles if/elif/else chains with condition and blocks

  - Updated lexNumber to check for digit after '.' before treating as float
- Created comprehensive unit tests (76 tests) covering:
  - All statement types (commands, declarations, control flow)
  - All expression types (binary operators, literals, variables)
  - Nested structures (function with for with if)
  - Error recovery scenarios
- Added Gradle toolchain resolver plugin (foojay-resolver-convention) for automatic JDK download

**Files created:**
- src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishElementTypes.kt
- src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishParser.kt
- src/test/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishParserTest.kt

**Files changed:**
- src/main/kotlin/com/elvish/plugin/parser/ElvishLexer.kt (fixed range operator lexing)
- settings.gradle.kts (added foojay resolver plugin for JDK auto-download)

**Learnings:**
- PsiBuilder marker pattern is key to AST construction: mark(), done(type), drop(), precede()
- Condition parsing in control flow must stop at LBRACE (block start) to avoid consuming the block
- Block parsing must skip whitespace before checking for RBRACE to handle whitespace between nested closing braces
- Lexer must check for digit after '.' to distinguish float (1.5) from range (1..10)
- Test PsiBuilder implementation requires implementing many interface methods as stubs
